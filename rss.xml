Angela West, a Harvard Law School graduate and former Los Angeles prosecutor, allegedly went to town on a Peet’s Coffee kiosk. With a three-foot metal pole. Tsk tsk, Ms. West. At HLS you’re expected to smash things with a finely crafted cane or perhaps a tasteful umbrella. A metal pole is unbecoming of your pedigree… The report from the San Francisco Chronicle (via SFist) is actually very funny: Angela West, 50, a Harvard Law School graduate, was seen by airport police officers smashing merchandise, milk containers and other food items with a 3-foot-long metal pole at a Peet’s Coffee kiosk at SFO on Christmas Eve, said San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe. When officers tried to speak to her, West “raged” at them and began swinging the pole, which she had taken from a janitor’s cart, Wagstaffe said. I can’t help picturing this 50-year-old woman dressed up like Neo and smashing milk cartons with a pole in slow motion, like Neo smashing hundreds of Agent Smiths. But I feel really sorry for the real-life police officers who had to subdue this crazy person: An officer had to use a chair to fend off at least 10 blows, authorities said. West then calmed down and sat in a booth, only to start throwing items at the officers, Wagstaffe said. When the officers tried to arrest her, she kicked one of them in the groin, Wagstaffe said. After being subdued, West shouted out that she was a lesbian and that the officers “should stop trying to have sex with her,” the prosecutor said. West was taken to a hospital and held in a psychiatric ward for a week, Wagstaffe said. But remember, we’re dealing with an HLS grad. Which means there’s a certain level of hubris that never leaves you. At a court hearing Tuesday, Judge Barbara Mallach allowed West to represent herself after learning that she had attended Harvard Law and was admitted to the California State Bar in 1989. West, however, has been inactive since 1997. West pleaded not guilty at Tuesday’s hearing, at which she also demanded a copy of the police report. Prosecutors asked for more time to prepare a redacted copy by removing witnesses’ addresses, but West objected, saying she was a former prosecutor and was “entitled to the information,” Wagstaffe said. Yeah, I think West is about to learn that the real world is much more cold and unforgiving than the Matrix that might exist within her head.

            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  “Oh, who owns New York?
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  Oh, who owns New York?
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  Oh, who owns New York the people say.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  Why, we own New York!
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  Why, we own New York!
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  C-O-L-U-M-B-I-A!”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  A century after the introduction of Columbia’s fight song, the University has become not only an institution of academic prestige, but a giant of New York City real estate. The extent of the University’s institutional property holdings has, however, remained largely unclear—until now.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  In the highest of published estimates, the RealDeal, a news outlet focused on commercial and residential real estate, &lt;a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/10/20/trd-pro-these-universities-have-the-largest-nyc-real-estate-footprints/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 that the University owned 216 buildings in New York City, totaling 13.9 million square feet in ownership. This estimate earns Columbia the title of the largest private landowner in New York City by number of addresses. Yet, it still underestimates the true size of the University’s real estate portfolio beyond holdings listed under “The Trustees Columbia University.”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  A Spectator analysis of the New York City Department of City Planning Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output has confirmed that Columbia owns at least 245 properties in New York City, exceeding previous estimates by nearly 30 properties. Confirmed properties have permits under one of at least 31 variations of “The Trustees of Columbia University.”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  Spectator also accessed a publicly available Accounting and Reporting at Columbia&lt;a href="https://www.finance.columbia.edu/content/arc-site-pivot-tree"&gt; document&lt;/a&gt; listed as “ARC Site Pivot Tree” under “Forms &amp; Documents,” which additionally lists at least 383 distinct addresses in New York City under “institutional real estate,” “Baker Field,” “Faculty Practice,” “Morningside Heights,” and “Manhattenville [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;].” “ARC Site Pivot Tree” included no complementary data dictionary. No other document made publicly available under “Forms &amp; Documents” by Columbia Finance defines the nature of the sites and addresses listed on “ARC Site Pivot Tree.”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  “The list from ARC referenced in this article represents site codes to track financial expenses associated with business activity and is therefore a much broader list than Columbia-owned properties,” a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator on April 27. “While the list contains some Columbia-owned properties, it also includes properties that Columbia leases, as well as properties with no ownership or lease affiliation with the university.”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  The 245 properties place Columbia far above peer institutions in New York City in terms of the number of properties it owns in the city. New York University and Fordham University &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page"&gt;trail behi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page"&gt;nd&lt;/a&gt; with 119 and 25 properties respectively, according to PLUTO.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  The largest of the University’s acquisitions are related to the construction of the Manhattanville campus, a $6 billion development spanning from 125th Street to 134th Street. Fifteen years into construction, University President Lee Bollinger characterized the development as “not even a third” complete in a November interview with Spectator.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;[Read More: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2023/01/19/bollingers-tenure-accentuated-a-contentious-decades-long-history-between-columbia-and-west-harlem-some-residents-say/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bollinger’s tenure accentuated a contentious, decadeslong history between Columbia and West Harlem, some residents say&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  To balance the potential displacement imposed by Bollinger’s keystone campus expansion into Manhattanville, the University collaborated with West Harlem community leaders to create the Community Benefits Agreement, a 50-page document outlining the precise obligations Columbia holds to the neighboring community. These commitments—including $4 million in legal assistance, $20 million in affordable housing, and $76 million in other resources to be administered by the West Harlem Development Corporation—were based on the “Project Site Map” illustrating the physical boundaries of the lot necessary for the new campus. According to the CBA, the University intended on building “approximately 6.8 million square feet of space,” over the document's 25-year plan.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  But beyond the immediate bounds of the burgeoning Manhattanville campus, currently the site of the Business School and School of the Arts, Spectator found that the ARC report lists an additional 16 addresses in the neighborhood as either “institutional real estate” or “Manhattenville [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;],” meaning Columbia owns, leases, or has “financial expenses associated with business activity” at these addresses.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  “[The CBA is] a commitment we have always handled with the utmost seriousness and respect,” a University spokesperson wrote in a previous statement to Spectator. “We have never violated any aspect of the agreement and we are exceedingly proud of all that it has accomplished through our partnership with the WHDC and the communities of Upper Manhattan.”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  According to the ARC reports, Columbia’s “institutional real estate” spans far beyond the communities the University has entered a formal agreement with. Outside of the Manhattanville, Morningside Heights, and Medical School campuses, the University’s lists an additional 239 addresses as “institutional real estate.”
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  As the University continues to acquire institutional real estate and progress toward the CBA’s 6.8 million square foot development goal, some local resident organizations face challenging negotiations with Columbia.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  The Morningside Heights Community Coalition has been locked in a&lt;a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2023/04/03/columbia-policy-institute-hosts-discussion-regarding-university-relationship-with-morningside-heights/"&gt; yearslong struggle&lt;/a&gt; for affordable housing inclusion within Columbia’s real estate acquisitions—and recent talks have seen little compromise from the University.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  Former MHCC president Laura Friedman said she hopes to see improved consideration for local residents in Columbia’s land use decisions. Most recently, the University began converting 611 W. 112th Street into Columbia’s &lt;a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2023/02/15/columbia-to-convert-former-hotel-the-maranamay-into-new-undergraduate-dorm/"&gt;newest undergraduate residence hall&lt;/a&gt; without plans for affordable housing for local residents.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  “You know, we’ve been in a lot of fights with Columbia over the years, believe me, you win a few, you lose a lot,” Friedman said.
&lt;/p&gt;




            &lt;p class="g-body paragraph"&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Correction: This article has been updated to more accurately reflect the nature of the ARC data. The article’s headline, which previously stated Columbia holds real estate under 184 pseudonyms, has been updated to reflect the uncertainty of the relationship between the University and the names associated with addresses listed in the ARC report as “institutional real estate,” in addition to “Baker Field,” “Faculty Practice,” “Morningside Heights,” and “Manhattenville [sic].” Additionally, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that PLUTO lists 263 properties under 33 variations of “Trustees of Columbia.” The article has been updated to say PLUTO lists 245 properties under 31 variations of “Trustees of Columbia.” The original number included properties under the name “Columbia Presbyterian” and “Teacher’s College of Columbia University.” This article initially included a property listed as 17 Smith Street as a listing of institutional real estate in New York City; the updated article removed 17 Smith Street after Spectator received information suggesting the address listed refers to a 17 Smith Street in Englewood, New Jersey. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Columbia has over 250 more property claims than New York University. Columbia has at least 245 properties in New York City, compared to New York University’s 119, according to PLUTO. A previous version of the article contained a graphic that worked under the premise that the sites listed in the ARC Site Pivot Tree were property holdings (including partial leases of buildings). Spectator removed this graphic. Spectator regrets this error.&lt;/i&gt;

       &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="footer g-body"&gt; &lt;div class="article-credits"&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Data Methodology: To determine the number of Columbia-owned properties, all owner names containing the word "Columbia" were searched in PLUTO, and this list of owner names was reduced to variations of "Trustees of Columbia University." The number of properties under these owner names were summed. All addresses listed on the Columbia Finance ARC Site Pivot Tree were inputted into NYC GeoSearch, an official New York City Department of Planning geocoding tool, to find respective Building Identification Number and Borough Block Lot Number. BINs and BBLs were then matched with PLUTO, where each match has a distinct address.

Today was your law school graduation, and I know you were there in spirit while I was there in person with my parents, your mom, your aunt, Julia, and all the Brooklyn Law School friends and faculty who loved the hell out of you. Honestly, as much as I loved being there to support your friends (and hear people fawn over you) today also ripped my heart out. I saw people cross the stage in their robes and weird hats and cords, waving to the crowd while their families screamed and cheered for them. I thought about how completely fucked up it was that you weren’t walking across to stage, rocking your robes and your law review and moot court cords, while I screamed your name from the rafters, taking a video of you in the process. It’s not fair, and there were several moments when I sat in my seat imagining a parallel universe where I did just that. And I wondered why the hell THIS is the reality that I have to live in, one where you’re not here, proud and relieved but also stressing out over bar. Idk, we got a raw fucking deal dude.

But there’s nothing to be done about it. So I went to your graduation as I would have done if you were here (sleep deprived bc I decided to hang out with @shame after their show and didn’t get back home until like 3 am…by the way, they said they’d dedicate their next NYC show to you 🤘🏾 still, I could hear you groaning “why would you stay out so late right before my graduation?” But come on, you know me by now. You also should know that I’m so SO proud of you. You accomplished so much, held so many prestigious internships, and made so many incredible friends along the way who call me an honorary BLS student. I’m so glad they set up a scholarship and Moot Court award in your name. You’re so deserving of a legacy at BLS.

I wish you were here. I know you were, in a way, but still. I miss you, I’m proud of you, I love you ♥️"</title><link>https://www.instagram.com/p/CsUlWPjO89O/?igshid=MmJiY2I4NDBkZg==</link><description>19K likes, 258 comments - Ashley Reese (@offbeatorbit) on Instagram: "Hey Rob 🎓 Or rather, Rob Stengel, J.D.

You smell the ink and the paper. You hear the dulcet tones of a piano over the PA system. And then it hits you, like a cannonball dropping in your lower abdomen. The acute, undeniable urge to evacuate your bowels. As you make a run for the nearest public washroom, you think to yourself, “Not again!” The scenario above will divide our readers. Some will be left scratching their head, wondering why I cooked up such a strange story. Others will be blushing. They will feel seen. Indeed, this peculiar confluence of events—feeling an overwhelming urge to go #2 while visiting a bookstore—has been reported time and time again, mostly in Japanese media, and it even has a name: Mariko Aoki phenomenon, after the young woman who inadvertently wrote it down in the annals of history. Sure, there had been mentions in literary work as early as the 1950s, and the occasional discussion on radio and television, but it was the February 1985 issue of Japan’s Hon no Zasshi (which translates to Book Magazine) that blew the lid on the phenomenon. The magazine printed a short letter from a woman named Mariko Aoki, who had realized that wandering inside a bookstore triggered this urge to relieve herself. Following publication, the magazine received several reports from readers who regularly experienced the same. Their next issue had a 14-page feature article on this unsolved mystery. The horse was out of the barn: the Mariko Aoki phenomenon was apparently, according to Book Magazine’s sensationalistic headline, “shaking the bookstore industry.” Taking a crack at finding the cause The Mariko Aoki phenomenon is a case study in how easy it is to generate hypotheses to explain something strange that makes little sense at face value. After all, what could possibly explain the intense—some have even said apocalyptic—urge to drop the kids off at the pool, but only specifically when inside a bookstore? Well, the brain abhors a vacuum, and when it starts speculating, it can be hard to stop. One leading theory points the finger at smells. Bookstores are full of books. Paper and ink carry a specific scent. Maybe tickling the old olfactory nerves in this specific way has pressing consequences down below? A few experiments have apparently been carried out in the Japanese media, such as on the television show The Real Side of Un’nan and by philosopher Kenji Tsuchiya, but the results, according to Wikipedia, have been negative. I use Wikipedia as a reference not without trepidation, but because the English-language academic literature seems mum on the topic of the Mariko Aoki phenomenon. Speculations abound in the printed Japanese media, and highlights have been made available in English on Wikipedia. It is thus difficult to access primary sources here. Another hypothesis takes us back to Pavlov. A Russian physiologist, Ivan Pavlov trained a hungry dog to salivate at the sound of a buzzer or metronome. He helped show that a response can become predictable in a certain environment by using reinforcement. If you are used to reading on the toilet, the thinking goes, maybe you start to associate books with defecation. Walking into a large bookstore would act like a buzzer to Pavlov’s dogs. Instead of salivating, the reflex would come from your bowels. Then there’s the conflicting theory of stress and relaxation. Some have posited that because life is stressful, walking into a bookstore—a calm oasis of intellectual rewards—acts as a release. On the other hand, the stress of having to pick the right book might actually speed up intestinal transit. Add to that any anticipatory anxiety over the possibility of having to go to the washroom and not being able to find one in time, and you end up creating the very problem you are trying to avoid. But hypotheses do not end here. Is it the vertical reading of spines, with the eyes moving up and down over and over, that triggers the urge? Is it the posture of squatting down to look at books, which facilitates defecation by straightening the rectum? Is it the exercise one gets from walking around a bookstore when they might otherwise be quite sedentary and afflicted with constipation? Is it the cup of coffee, known to speed things up down there, that is served at the bookstore or that is drunk before going book shopping? The list of hypotheses is as long and bendy as the large intestine itself, and it ends in utter flights of fancy such as the influence of a book’s psychic energy on the intestinal transit system. The pooping delusion Some don’t bite and ascribe the Mariko Aoki phenomenon to a simple frequency illusion. You may have heard of the 11:11 phenomenon. Some people believe the time 11:11 holds spiritual meaning. Once they notice 11:11 on a clock, they start to notice it regularly. It’s not that 11:11 suddenly comes up more often, or that they are drawn to the clock at 11:11 by some spiritual entity crudely attempting communication. It’s simply that these people notice the times when the clock says 11:11 and don’t pay attention when it doesn’t. Similarly, if you start to make a connection between being in a bookstore and experiencing this dramatic need to relieve yourself, you may notice it the next time it happens, but not necessarily when it happens at the cinema or when it doesn’t happen the next time you visit the bookstore. Bulking up this theory is the fact that for some, bookstores don’t do it. It’s the arts and crafts store. It’s Best Buy. It’s Target. In fact, websites like Reddit are full of comments from people who identify with the Mariko Aoki phenomenon, but for whom the trigger is a different type of store, usually a big box store where one might spend a lot of time. Some will push back against this and bear down on the accusation that these are just normal bowel movements that are noticed because they are triggered in public places. These are no ordinary craps, they say. The pressure is abrupt and forceful. It might be characterized the way comedian Robin Williams talked about the end of his colonoscopy in 2002: “FIRE IN THE HOLE!” A recent visit I paid to a medical specialist proved unintentionally enlightening toward the Mariko Aoki phenomenon. The doctor told me that, when it comes to complicated, chronic conditions, patients often look for a single trigger, one cause to explain it all. But often, the triggers are many. One person’s symptoms can be caused by many triggers, but the same symptom in many people can have different causes too. We shouldn’t rule out complexity. It’s possible that all of the theories surrounding the Mariko Aoki phenomenon are true, and that each applies to a subset of the people afflicted with it. For some, it may be the coffee. For others, the state of relaxation that browsing brings about helps with their mild constipation. For others, choice paralysis might stress the colon out. And for some, it’s just a question of making a connection where there really is none. All of these hypotheses might be correct. Except for psychic energy. That’s a crappy explanation. Take-home message: -The Mariko Aoki phenomenon is the name given to the overwhelming urge some people apparently feel to defecate whenever they find themselves in a bookstore -It was named after Mariko Aoki, whose short letter describing this bizarre association was published by a Japanese magazine in 1985 -Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the phenomenon, including the smell of books, stress, relaxation, and simply the illusion of an association, with no clear answer to this puzzling condition @CrackedScience</description></item><item><title>TV’s Streaming Model Is Broken.
